[Blast Ring Image Generator](https://github.com/happykhan/BRIG) (BRIG) command-line client and Python scripting API for interactive D3 visualizations (html + svg)

## Motivation

Reviving a small project from ages ago that produces fairly useful, self-contained D3 visualizations of BLAST identity and genome annotations in the classic circular format of BRIG. Mainly because the amazing `BRIG` - which has been widely used for whole genome visualization of bacterial genome similarity and annotations - is a little dated. I wanted to be able to customize and explore the ring annotations with parsers for recent annotation tools, while maintaining the ability to output useful figures for publications. This is an old codebase to be worked on for fun on the side to modernize and make it more convenient (dubbed `brick`). It was triggered by a small case report we are currently working on, in which we sequence and describe a novel _Mycobacterium_ genome from a bone and joint infection.
