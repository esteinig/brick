# BRICK

[`BRIG`]()-like interactive data visualization for bacterial whole genome annotation and comparison ([https://brick.ink](https://brick.ink))

## Overview

`BRICK` is under active development. Please note there is currently no guarantee for data persistence in the web application or backwards compatabiltity until major version release. 

## Web service (convenient)

At the moment, the most convenient way to get started is by using our web application ([https://brick.ink](https://brick.ink)).

In the current iteration of the web application, note that:

* File uploads and session data in the web application are automatically deleted seven days after creation
* You can navigate away at any time and come back to the session page (unique identifier)
* You can share your (editable) session with colleagues using the session page URL
* Download your session data from the application to persist your visualization data

Please note there is currently no guarantee for backwards compatability until major version release.

## Local application (easy)

You can run a pre-configured local production stack of the latest release with `Docker`:

```bash
# Clone latest stable release on main
git clone https://github.com/esteinig/brick && cd brick

# -d for detached mode
docker compose --profile prod up 

# Application available in your browser at: http://localhost:5173/ 
```

Some minor unit tests can be run with the `tests` service:

```bash
docker compose run tests
```

Update to the latest stable version onm `main`:

```bash
git pull # update main
docker compose --profile prod up --build 
```

## Server application (advanced)

See the `docker` subdirectory for reverse-proxy and alternative service configurations using `Traefik`. 

If you are hosting your own instance of the application on the web, my assumption is that know what you are doing and have enough background knowledge to modify `docker/traefik/web/dynamic.yml` and `docker/docker-compose.web.yml`. Please ensure proper attribution if you are running your own web-instance, it helps to keep our main server running :heart:  

In this example, we are using the pre-configured `localhost` reverse-proxy to test deployment on a local machine (`http://brick.localhost/`), assuming you have no other reverse-proxy service running:

```bash
# Create the external `proxy` network which 
# connects your stack with the reverse-proxy
docker network create proxy

# Link the localhost stack and traefik service
# into the current repository
ln -s docker/docker-compose.localhost.yml .
ln -s docker/docker-compose.traefik.localhost.yml .

# Create a secrets directory captured in `.gitignore` 
# and copy the default secret files for the stack database
mkdir .secrets
cp docker/mongodb/* .secrets/

# Modify the secret files, one line per file, line endings are stripped 
# automatically on server start in case you use `nano` or other editors
# that introduce them by default

# Up the reverse proxy service
docker compose -f docker-compose.traefik.localhost.yml up -d

# Up the production stack
docker compose -f docker-compose.localhost.yml up

# Application available in your browser at: http://brick.localhost/
```

The production stack comes with an (optional) database cleaner that safely removes sessions and session working directories in the `work` volume, which can be activated using the `--profile server` flag:

```bash
docker compose --profile prod --profile server up 
```

Default interval (every day) and expiration time (7 days) can be changed in `docker-compose.yml`:

```yml
command: brick utils clean --expire-days 7 --day-of-week "*" --time-of-day '04:00' --log /tmp/brick-cleaner.log
```

If you are running a web-instance through `Cloudflare` you need to set your SSL configuration to `strict`. 

## Development

Any and all questions, suggestions for improvement, bug reports, pull requests and ideas you would like to see implemented are welcome! Please open an [issue](https://github.com/esteinig/brick/issues) in this repository. Development and pull requests can be made on the [`dev`](https://github.com/esteinig/brick/tree/dev) branch.

## Dependencies

`BRICK` would not be possible without the amazing work of bioinformaticians and researchers who make their software available open-source. 
If you use their tools in the visualization, please cite the following publications:

Similarly, the stack would not be possible without the following amazing tools:

## Etymology

`BRICK` is not very brick-like... and **BR**IG-like **I**nteractive **C**ircular **K**nowledgebase is a bit of a stretch ðŸ‘€
